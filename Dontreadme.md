## Arithmetic Operators
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)

  *Note*: Integer devision is truncated (rounded down)
  
  To circumvent this convert the numerator to a double and make sure the quotient is a double

  `22/6 = 3`
  
  `(double)(3/4) = 0.0`
5. Modulo/Remainder (%)
  
  *Note*: 19%3=1 because 19/3 has remainder 1
- Integer division is computed first before casting to `double`

The operators follow PEMDAS

1. ( )
2. There are no exponents
3. *, /, % left-to-right
4. +, -
